# Colloidal-Particle-Size-Analyzer

This is the <b>Colloidal Particle Size Analyzer</b>  web application, which facilitates the users to upload an image having colloidal particles in the form of a circle and get their size distribution in the image. <br> <br>

This method of size analysis is solely based on the Deep-Learning Approach. All the computations are done and tested for varieties of images, that's how the model is trained to give accurate results.
